# Circus Shootout (MGDCFirstPerson2024)
## Itch Description
The Miami University Game Design Club meets weekly to create a game from start to finish in a time-based goal of four hours. All game art, programming, and design is done from scratch during the meeting, with the self-imposed time restriction leading to bizarre and creative outcomes. Students do interdisciplinary work across art, design, development and more to learn new software, techniques, and development practices. Ultimately, this process leads to an improvement and showcase of students' skills in preparation for the game industry's demanding requirements and time frames.

This week's goal was to create a two 3D First Person Survival Games using Unity and Unreal. External art assets were created using Blender, and some sound effects sourced from FreeSounds.
